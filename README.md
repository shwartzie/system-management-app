### Enjoy accessing and playing around with the requests for handling projects and tasks!


### NOTICE: I had an idea to create a second database for tests only. However the second database costs money so imagine the data that is being created while running the tests, are supposed to be created in a test database idealy. I created integration tests too since they are mocking the real flow of the program since that's what I really care about, rather than looking for small detailes nested inside the flow.


## Test instructions
```
cd backend
``` 
```
npm run test
```


### Misc
(Git, Jest, TypesScript, NodeJS (Express), AWS Cognito Userpool + IAM, MongoDB + Compass)

# Read the attached Deployment suggestion in the repo, for the following infrastructure ! :)
