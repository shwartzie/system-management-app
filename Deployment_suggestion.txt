For the frontend part, Using Next.js for pages that are static such as login, signup and MFA you can use SSG.
However for the dynamic pages which most of them are, you should use SSR, since the data needs to be up to date!

For the server, we can use tools that can create an efficient load balancer such as Kubernetes for example.
Load balancer will improve the performance since it handles huge amounts of requests by navigating it efficiently.

Working on the project thought me about the features AWS provides, For exmaple I'd like to add that we can add AWS CloudWatch to monitor the traffic,
in order to have the ability to change for example the way the load balancer works, meaning which algorithm can be used to be more efficient.
