Objective:
Create a RESTful API for a simple task management system. The system should allow users to manage projects and tasks with user authentication via AWS Cognito. 
The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow best practices.

Assignment Requirements:
Project Setup:

Initialize a Node.js project using TypeScript.
Use Express.js or any other Node.js framework.
Use an ORM like Mongoose or Sequelize for database interaction.
Core Features:

User Authentication:
Implement user authentication using AWS Cognito User Pool (for this task, you can create these users manually).
Project Management:
CRUD operations for projects.
Each project should have a name and description.
Task Management:
CRUD operations for tasks within a project.
Each task should have a title, description, and status (e.g., todo, in-progress, done).
Additional Features:

Include basic logging and error handling.
Implement pagination in GET requests.
Extra: implement role-based access control (e.g., admin, user).
Testing:
Write unit tests for core functionality using a testing framework like Jest.

Submission Guidelines:
Code Repository: Provide a link to a GitHub (or similar) repository containing the code.
Deployment Suggestion: Provide a description of how you suggest this project should be deployed if it needs to handle 10k users a day and includes a client-side in Next.js.
